# Sponsoring Dokku

If there is some functionality missing from Dokku, outside of [contributing the functionality](/CONTRIBUTING.md), you may also consider sponsoring the work.

The following are examples of sponsored features added to Dokku:

- Bespoke application deployment for self-hosted software. Recent examples include:
  - [Metabase](https://metabase.com/): Business intelligence and analytics for your company.
  - [The Lounge](https://thelounge.chat/): Self-hosted web IRC client.
  - [Zammad](https://zammad.org/): Open source user support/ticketing solution.
- [Buildpack management](https://github.com/dokku/dokku/issues/3256) via plugin.
- Backup support for [datastore plugins](https://github.com/dokku/dokku-postgres/pull/86).
- [Kubernetes integration](https://github.com/dokku/dokku-scheduler-kubernetes) for application deploys.
- Complete HA integration with your cloud vendor of choice (AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean, GCP...).
- Debugging Dokku features and functionality for use in specific cloud environments (with upstream changes as necessary).
- Traefik proxy support

If you or your organization could benefit from sponsored Dokku development - or debugging complex issues related to using Dokku - the following are some bulletpoints that you might find useful:

- Functionality is scoped out prior to any development so that both parties understand what is being delivered.
- Typical engagements are less than 10 hours, with most lasting only 2.
- All new features and bugfixes that can be are open-sourced to ease future development of the platform.
  - If the development requires integrating with something in-house, we'll develop interfaces between Dokku and your systems to ensure the integration won't break in the future.
- The hourly rate begin at $200 USD per hour, paid before delivery of services. Longer engagements can be negotiated.
- Payment can be done through a variety of methods, and billing can be sent if needed for your finance department.

If the above seems like a good fit for you or your project, feel free to contact `@savant` on the [Gliderlabs Slack or Dokku Discord](https://dokku.com/docs/getting-started/where-to-get-help/#monitored-locations), or send an email to [email-for-consulting@josediazgonzalez.com](mailto:email-for-consulting@josediazgonz.com).
